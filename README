This is a modified verison of the popular galga game!

Credit:

This is my first try of implementing a game; I learned a lot of tricks from ndass6.
Here is his repo link: https://github.com/ndass6/Galaga

Details:
In this game, you CANNOT shoot! All you can do is to dodge all the suicidal bugs charging at you!
If you got hit by a bug, both you and the bug die.


Don't worry, once the bug hits the wall, it will get trapped by the dark force of the universe and will do no harm anymore.
Once it passes you, it won't come back either, as they give up easily.

Use arrows keys to move the ship up, down, left and right.

In the start scene ,press button B ('X' on keyboard) to play.
When you lost a live but not all yet, press Enter to continue.
When you lost all lives, press Enter to go back to start scene.
When you clear a level but not all yet, press Enter to try the next level.
When you beat the game, press Enter to go back to start scene.

In the middle of the game, press button A ('Z' on keyboard) anytime to reset the game.
WARNING: doing so will reset everything and send you back to level 1, restoring all lives and eneimes!

Tip:
Try to find a gap to move to the upper part of the screen, since bugs only know charging forward.


And MOST IMPORTANTLY: HAVE FUN!!!!
